Clanging\rObstinate shades, clinging to so much dust\rVenture out to obscure the direction\rVoices soaked with longing for Armageddon\rAsked the children where [are] you leading\rBack to the garden of Eden\r\rEvil beat, masses drum, marching tones, everyone\rConsciousness from gray to stark, audience to a talking shark\rI laid awake, babies slept\rBabble laughed, Jesus wept\r\rThe truth emerged but was quickly lost in trumpet blasts of chaos\rWhich left only an inner voice that knows the truth is not a choice\rWhat really was obscured somehow\rRaise it up and come on down [we need you now]\r\rBridge:\rAnd we'll rise together\r[In] connected loving style\rAnd we'll find each other\rWith the power of four smiles\r\rAnd we'll use the sorrow\rThat raged down through the years\rTo view the next day\rWith the vision of three tears\r",

            lyrics: "So much love in the world\rLet's face it almost everyone is good\rLost beauty stripped in a time to be\rA mind is a vast mentality\rHalf full in this half empty cup\rIt's hard to beat everybody's up\rWe don't have to go where it's wrong\rWe're just getting started down to where we belong\rThe weather's fine, I think I'll stay\rThese are better days\r\rIf we could only wish in a manner\rA dream in which to evolve\rParadigm switch, the itch, crippled bent\rNo longer relevant behind the resolve\rTruth is in the choice \rTo speak a new voice\rA new place where it's at \rMaybe we could imagine that\rDemonstrating the peace is all the rage\rThese are better days\r\rChorus:\rIf it was up to you\rIf it was to me\rThis world was made for love\rLet's get together and we could shine \rLike a shining star\r\rInstitutions institute a warning that you know too much\rWhen you know of a knowing that can't be touched\rThey may hold office... Nightstick, pistol-grip, bags of money, governorship\rOr a twisted yearning for a fabled gem\rThere's still more of us than there are of them\rDreaming on the corner feeling the rays\rThese are better days\r\rYou can't only complain you know\rYou've got to give the world a place to go\rAll the people gathered 'round\rRising up on a magic sound\rHeavy pressure caused the glow to shine\rA spirited push to change the paradigm\rAll the happy people singing a praise\rThese are better days\r",

            lyrics: "The past shows no glory\rFor those who know\rWe live to feel, feel to know\r\rRound up your troops\rLet your anger flow\rLook what they did to us\r10,000 years ago\r\rChorus:\rLook to the future\rIt's in your eyes\rHang on to the picture\rThat's in your mind\r\rWell, it happened to me\rLet it happen to you\rWe're gonna get the music\rTo see us through\r\rHey there buddy\rWon't you climb on my back\rYou can't hate the world\rFor everything it lacks",

            lyrics: "Raining, leaves are falling, water\u2019s getting high\rAs I gently wonder how long I\u2019ll be alive\rIt\u2019s been both pleasure, pain, and dream\rTo be known as what\u2019s been known as me\r\rWilling spirit cast upon a sea\rA spark of oxygen and acetylene\rI can feel it now\rRaging in the night\r\rJust/judge fools parade the alley\rShades of ??\rHow I long to engage in art and simplicity\rBe with me in the fabulous yet to be\r\rIn the time shine of an up\rBreeze and buttercup\rThings felt but never known\rSet to rhyme\r\rBy breathing on its own/ Vibrating on a tone\rBorne just this far from home\rHeart, soul, and mind\rSet in time\r\rPedestrian heartache fingers in a vise\rMy blood is pounding in the fever of your lies\rI have to laugh out loud\rWhispered from the joke I told you so",

Song.create!(title: "I Need a Love at My Side",
            lyrics: "Walking in the pale sun fighting the blues\rWhen come up a huckster salesman in a flat plaid suit\rAsk what you need we\u2019ll get you plenty to choose\rI said I don\u2019t want nothin\u2019 that I can\u2019t use\r\rDon\u2019t want a ball cap that looks like a sign\rA popcorn maker that tells the time\rI don\u2019t need a truth that seconds as a trick\rOr a jewel-crusted pogo stick\rDon\u2019t want a machine to tell me how to breathe\rOr a motorcycle that rakes the leaves\rBut if you\u2019re really asking me I\u2019ll tell you what I need\r\rChorus:\rI need a love at my side\rThat makes a pair to share the ride\rAnd deeply adore one to care for\rWhere reflections on each other flatter\rWhere when you do what you do it seems to matter\rSomeone to share life\u2019s laughs and cries\rI need a love at my side\r\rNow it\u2019s hedging back and forth as hope begins to fade\rYou can\u2019t sell something that can\u2019t be made\rHis eyes then struck a tone\rThat said you\u2019re on your own\r\rChorus\r\rWell I have to decline but it\u2019s kind of you to ask\rI don\u2019t need a basketball that\u2019s made of glass\rOr a heart that only gets half full\rI don\u2019t want another impossible",
